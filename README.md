(It's my first program. I was written this while I was learing Python)

**Start:** python main.py <br/>
Paste your text into the text.txt file

**Aviable actions:**
1. Print text - it just display the text
2. Count the words - counts the number of words
3. Basic statistics - this action shows: 
    - Number of words
    - Number of all characters
    - Number of characters without spaces
    - Number of punctuation marks
    - Number of digits
    - Number of sentence
